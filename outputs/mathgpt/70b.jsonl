The problem states that we need to find the number of zeroes at the end of the product of the first 2006 consecutive prime numbers.\n2. To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of factorial and the relationship between prime numbers and factorial.\n3. In mathematics, a factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n4. In a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of 5s in the product. This is because 5 * 2 = 10, which contributes one zero at the end of the product.\n5. To find the number of 5s in a factorial, we can divide the integer by 5 and take the floor value. For example, floor(120/5) = 24. This means that 120 has 24 5s in its factorization.\n6. In a factorial, the number of 2s is always one more than the number of 5s. This is because every other number in the factorial is divisible by 2.\n7. However, in the product of prime numbers, the number of 2s is equal to the number of 5s. This is because every prime number except 2 is odd, and odd numbers have a factor of 5.\n8. Therefore, the number of trailing zeroes in the product of the first 2006 consecutive prime numbers is equal to the number of 5s in 2006!.\n9. To find the number of 5s in 2006!, we divide 2006 by 5 and take the floor value: floor(2006/5) = 401.\n10. However, we need to consider that there are additional 5s in the factorization of 2006!. Every multiple of 5 less than 2006 contributes an additional 5.\n11. The number of multiples of 5 less than 2006 is floor(2006/5) = 401.\n12. Therefore, the total number of 5s in 2006! is 401 + 401 = 802.\n13. Since the number of 2s is always one more than the number of 5s, the number of 2s in 2006! is 802 + 1 = 803.\n14. However, we are only interested in the number of trailing zeroes, which is determined by the number of 5s.\n15. Therefore, the product of the first 2006 consecutive prime numbers ends with 802 zeroes.\n16. [Final solution] Thus, the product of the first 2006 consecutive prime numbers ends with 802 zeroes.\nTherefore, the final result is 802.\nBy problem, the option corresponding to 802 is not given.\nSo our selection is option C. #### C ", "pred": "C", "gold": "B", "result": false}

In this case, the ones digit is $y$. We can see that $y$ must be $5$ or $0$ for the number to be divisible by $5$.\n4. To determine if a number is divisible by $9$, we need to check if the sum of all the digits is divisible by $9$. In this case, the sum of the digits is $2 + 4 + x + 8 + y = 14 + x + y$. We can see that $14 + x + y$ must be divisible by $9$ for the number to be divisible by $9$.\n5. By steps 2 and 3, we have two possible values for $y$: $0$ and $4$. We can substitute these values into the equation from step 4 to find the corresponding values for $x$.\n   - If $y = 0$, then $14 + x + 0 = 14 + x$. We need to find the value of $x$ that makes $14 + x$ divisible by $9$. The only value that satisfies this condition is $x = 5$.\n   - If $y = 4$, then $14 + x + 4 = 14 + x$. We need to find the value of $x$ that makes $14 + x$ divisible by $9$. The only value that satisfies this condition is $x = 1$.\n6. By steps 5, we have two possible values for $x$: $5$ and $1$. We can substitute these values into the equation from step 4 to find the corresponding values for $y$.\n   - If $x = 5$, then $14 + 5 + y = 19 + y$. We need to find the value of $y$ that makes $19 + y$ divisible by $9$. The only value that satisfies this condition is $y = 0$.\n   - If $x = 1$, then $14 + 1 + y = 15 + y$. We need to find the value of $y$ that makes $15 + y$ divisible by $9$. The only value that satisfies this condition is $y = 4$.\n7. By steps 6, we have two possible pairs of values for $x$ and $y$: $x = 5$ and $y = 0$, and $x = 1$ and $y = 4$.\n8. The sum of the digits $x$ and $y$ is $5 + 0 = 5$ or $1 + 4 = 5$. Therefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $5$.\n9.

The problem states that a clinical trial was conducted to determine whether a certain vitamin improves the general health of adults. The investigators identified 85 variables that measure various aspects of the general health of adults. Each adult in the trial was measured for each variable before and after taking the vitamin for three months. The investigators then performed 85 matched-pair t-tests, one for each variable. They found statistically significant results at the 0.05 level in 2 of the variables, both in the direction of improved general health. We need to determine what the investigators should conclude based on these results.\n\n2. In a clinical trial, it is common to perform multiple tests on the data. However, when multiple tests are performed, the probability of obtaining a statistically significant result by chance increases. This is known as the problem of multiple comparisons.\n\n3. In this case, the investigators performed 85 tests, and they obtained 2 statistically significant results at the 0.05 level. To determine the probability of obtaining 2 or more statistically significant results by chance, we can use the binomial distribution.\n\n4. The binomial distribution calculates the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. In this case, each test can be considered a Bernoulli trial, and a success is defined as obtaining a statistically significant result at the 0.05 level.\n\n5. Using the binomial distribution, we can calculate the probability of obtaining 2 or more statistically significant results by chance. The probability is given by 1 - (1 - 0.05)^85.\n\n6.

The problem states that we need to find the number of zeroes at the end of the product of the first 2006 consecutive prime numbers.\n2. To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of factorial and the relationship between prime numbers and factorial.\n3. In mathematics, a factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n4. In a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of 5s in the product. This is because 5 * 2 = 10, which contributes one zero at the end of the product.\n5. To find the number of 5s in a factorial, we can divide the integer by 5 and take the floor value. For example, floor(120/5) = 24. This means that 120 has 24 5s in its factorization.\n6.

We need to determine which of the following statements must be true.\n2. A p-value of 0.03 indicates that the observed difference between the means is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, given that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, the evidence favors the alternative hypothesis that the means are different.\n3. However, a p-value does not provide information about the magnitude or direction of the difference between the means. It only tells us that the difference is statistically significant.\n4. Therefore, a 90% confidence interval for the difference in means could contain the value 0, since the confidence interval provides a range of values that are likely to include the true difference in means.\n5. Similarly, a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means could also contain the value 0.\n6. However, a 99% confidence interval for the difference in means is less likely to contain the value 0, since the confidence level is higher and the range of values is narrower.\n7.

The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all three numbers.\n3. To find the LCM, we need to prime factorize each number and take the highest power of each prime factor. \n   - The prime factorization of 4 is 2^2.\n   - The prime factorization of 5 is 5^1.\n   - The prime factorization of 6 is 2^1 * 3^1.\n4.

The problem states that we need to find out how many digits are required to write down the numbers from 1 to 99, given that no adjacent digits that are identical are written down.\n2. To solve this problem, we can divide it into three cases: the numbers from 1 to 9, the numbers from 10 to 99 that start with 1, and the numbers from 10 to 99 that do not start with 1.\n3. In the first case, we have the numbers 1 to 9, which require 9 digits in total.\n4. In the second case, we have the numbers 10 to 19, which require 2 digits each.

We need to find out the total work done on the box as it slides to the bottom of the incline.\n\n2. The total work done on the box can be calculated by adding the work done by gravity and the work done by friction.\n\n3. The work done by gravity is equal to the change in potential energy. The potential energy is given by the formula mgh, where m is the mass of the box, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height. In this case, m = 40 kg, g = 9.8 m/s^2, and h = 8 m. Therefore, the change in potential energy is 40 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 8 m = 2912 J.\n\n4. The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is given by the formula 1/2mv^2, where m is the mass of the box and v is the velocity. In this case, m = 40 kg and the velocity can be calculated using the formula v = sqrt(2gh), where g is the acceleration due to gravity and h is the height.

By problem, it took Grandpa Gao 12 minutes to walk from the first tree to the 13th tree. Since he walked at an even speed, we can calculate the time it takes for him to walk one tree: 12 minutes / 12 trees = 12 / 12 = 1 minute per tree.\n\n3. By problem, when Grandpa Gao reached back to the fifth tree, it took him 50 minutes.

Therefore, the expression 2003n is not always odd.\n3. Option B: n^3. To determine if this expression is odd, we need to consider the value of n. If n is even, then n^3 will be even. If n is odd, then n^3 will be odd. Therefore, the expression n^3 is not always odd.\n4. Option C: n+2004. To determine if this expression is odd, we need to consider the value of n. If n is even, then n+2004 will be even. If n is odd, then n+2004 will be odd. Therefore, the expression n+2004 is not always odd.\n5. Option D: 2n^2+2003. To determine if this expression is odd, we need to consider the value of n. If n is even, then 2n^2 will be even, and adding 2003 to an even number will result in an odd number. If n is odd, then 2n^2 will be even, and adding 2003 to an even number will result in an odd number. Therefore, the expression 2n^2+2003 is always odd.\n6. [Final solution] Thus, the number that is odd regardless of the value of n is 2n^2+2003.\nTherefore, the final result is 2n^2+2003.\nBy problem, the option corresponding to 2n^2+2003 is D.\nSo our selection is option D. #### D ", "pred": "D", "gold": "D", "result": true}

The problem states that Jack is 8 years old and her mother is 34 years old. We need to find out how old Jack is when her mother is 3 times as old as Xiao Dong.\n2. By problem, Jack's mother is 34 years old. To find out how old Xiao Dong is, we divide the mother's age by 3: 34 years old / 3 = 34 / 3 = 11.33 years old.\n3. By problem, Jack is 8 years old. To find out how old Jack is when her mother is 3 times as old as Xiao Dong, we subtract Xiao Dong's age from Jack's age: 8 years old - 11.33 years old = 8 - 11.33 = -3.33 years old.\n4. Since we cannot have a negative age, we take the absolute value of -3.33 years old: |-3.33| = 3.33 years old.\n5. By problem, we need to find out how old Jack is when her mother is 3 times as old as Xiao Dong. Since Xiao Dong is 11.33 years old, Jack's mother is 3 times as old as Xiao Dong.

To find the difference between the original score and the corrected score, we subtract $22$ from $32$: $32 - 22 = 10$.\n3. Since the score of $32$ is the highest in the set of scores, it will definitely affect the mean. The mean is calculated by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of scores.

The problem states that there are 25 players in a chess tournament. Each game is played by 2 players, and each player plays every other player exactly once. We need to find out the total number of games played in the tournament.\n\n2. To find the total number of games, we need to choose 2 players from a group of 25 players. This is a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)!r!], where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items chosen at a time.\n\n3. By problem, there are 25 players and we need to choose 2 players for each game. So we have C(25, 2) = 25! / [(25-2)!2!].\n\n4. Simplifying the expression, we have C(25, 2) = 25! / [23!2!].\n\n5. By definition, n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. So 25! = 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.\n\n6.

Therefore, the starting time is 23:50 - 2 hours and 5 minutes.\n4. To calculate the starting time, we need to convert the hours and minutes to decimal form. 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes and 5 minutes is 5 minutes. Therefore, the duration of the movie is 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.\n5. By step 3, the starting time is 23:50 - 125 minutes.

The problem states that a party game played with a six-sided dice is fair if the chance of winning is equal to the chance of losing each time the dice is rolled. We need to determine which game is fair based on this criteria.\n2. By problem, the dice has 6 sides.\n3. Option A states that you win if you roll a 6. There is only one 6 on the dice, so the probability of winning is 1/6.\n4. Option B states that you win if you roll a 2 or a 5. There is one 2 and one 5 on the dice, so the probability of winning is 2/6 = 1/3.\n5. Option C states that you win if you roll a number greater than 4. There are two numbers greater than 4 on the dice (5 and 6), so the probability of winning is 2/6 = 1/3.\n6. Option D states that you win if you roll a number less than 3. There are two numbers less than 3 on the dice (1 and 2), so the probability of winning is 2/6 = 1/3.\n7. Option E states that you win if you roll an odd number. There are three odd numbers on the dice (1, 3, and 5), so the probability of winning is 3/6 = 1/2.\n8. By step 7, we can see that the probability of winning is not equal to the probability of losing for option E. Therefore, option E is not a fair game.\n9. By steps 3, 4, 5, and 6, we can see that the probability of winning is equal to the probability of losing for options A, B, C, and D. Therefore, these options are fair games.\n10. [Final solution] Thus, the fair games are options A, B, C, and D. However, option A is the only one that is a fair game. Therefore, the final result is You win if you roll a 6.\nBy problem, the option corresponding to You win if you roll a 6 is A.\nSo our selection is option A. #### A ", "pred": "A", "gold": "E", "result": false}

Therefore, the final result is 15.\n4. For the expression $$9+1+5$$, we start by adding 9 and 1 together: $$9+1=10$$. Then, we add 5 to 10: $$10+5=15$$. Therefore, the final result is also 15.\n5. By comparing the two expressions, we can see that both expressions yield the same result, which is 15.\n6. However, the problem asks us to determine which expression is easier to calculate. \n7. By analyzing the operations in each expression, we can see that the expression $$9+5+1$$ requires adding two larger numbers (9 and 5) together, while the expression $$9+1+5$$ requires adding a larger number (9) and a smaller number (1) together.\n8. Since adding two larger numbers is generally easier than adding a larger number and a smaller number, we can conclude that the expression $$9+5+1$$ is easier to calculate.\n9.

The problem states that we need to find the probability of rolling a fair six-sided die twice and getting a total of $8$.\n2. To find the probability, we need to consider all the possible outcomes that result in a total of $8$.\n3. The only way to get a total of $8$ is by rolling a $4$ on the first die and a $4$ on the second die.\n4. Since each die has six sides, the probability of rolling a $4$ on the first die is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n5. Similarly, the probability of rolling a $4$ on the second die is also $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n6.

The problem states that in guinea pigs, coat texture is determined by a complete dominance gene: rough coats are dominant to smooth coats. We need to find out the percentage of offspring expected to have smooth coats when two guinea pigs heterozygous for coat texture have offspring.\n2. Since the two parents are heterozygous for coat texture, they each have one gene for rough coat and one gene for smooth coat. When they mate, each parent contributes one gene to the offspring. Therefore, the offspring will have one gene for rough coat and one gene for smooth coat, making them heterozygous for coat texture.\n3. In complete dominance, the dominant trait is expressed in the phenotype. In this case, the rough coat is dominant to the smooth coat. Therefore, all of the offspring will have rough coats.\n4. However, since the offspring are heterozygous for coat texture, they can still pass on the gene for smooth coat to their offspring.\n5. To find the percentage of offspring expected to have smooth coats, we need to calculate the probability that both parents pass on the gene for smooth coat. Since each parent has a 1/2 chance of passing on the gene for smooth coat, the probability that both parents pass on the gene for smooth coat is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%.\n6.

The problem states that a computer card game keeps track of the number of games played and the number of games won on that computer. We need to determine under which situation X, the number of games won out of 100 games, would be a binomial random variable.\n2. A binomial random variable is a variable that represents the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. In this case, each game can be considered a Bernoulli trial, and the number of games played is fixed at 100.\n3. To determine if X is a binomial random variable, we need to check if the games are independent and if the outcome of each game is based on the skill of the player.\n4. Option A states that all games were played by the same player, whose skill improved over the course of the 100 games. This situation violates the condition of independent games because the player's skill improves over time, making the games dependent on each other. Therefore, option A is not the correct situation.\n5. Option B states that a group of 5 players of different skill levels were each allowed to play 20 games in a row. This situation satisfies the condition of independent games because each player plays a fixed number of games and the outcome of each game is based on the skill of the player. Therefore, option B is the correct situation.\n6. Option C states that a group of players of different skill levels were each allowed to play until they had lost 3 games, resulting in 100 games played. This situation violates the condition of independent games because the number of games played by each player is not fixed. Therefore, option C is not the correct situation.\n7. Option D states that two players of equal skill level each played one game a day for 50 days, and their skill level did not change from day to day. This situation satisfies the condition of independent games because each player plays a fixed number of games and the outcome of each game is based on the skill of the player. However, the problem states that the number of games played is 100, so option D is not the correct situation.\n8. Option E states that two players of different skill levels competed by allowing one player to continue until a game was lost, then the other player to continue until a game was lost, and so on, until 100 games were played. This situation violates the condition of independent games because the number of games played by each player is not fixed. Therefore, option E is not the correct situation.\n9.

The problem states that a car and a truck are both traveling with a constant speed of 30 m/s. The car is 20 m behind the truck. The truck driver suddenly applies his brakes, causing the truck to slow to a stop at the constant rate of 3 m/s^2. We need to determine the constant rate at which the car slowed.\n\n2. Let's assume that the time it took for the truck to stop is \"t\" seconds. We can set up the equation: v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and s is the distance traveled.\n\n3. For the truck, the initial velocity is 30 m/s, the final velocity is 0 m/s, and the distance traveled is 20 m. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n   (0 m/s)^2 = (30 m/s)^2 + 2a(20 m)\n   0 = 900 + 40a\n   40a = 900\n   a = 900/40\n   a = 22.5 m/s^2\n\n4. Now, let's find the time it took for the truck to stop. We can use the equation: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\n5. For the truck, the initial velocity is 30 m/s, the final velocity is 0 m/s, and the acceleration is 22.5 m/s^2.

We can use the equation: s = ut + 0.5at^2, where s is the distance traveled, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.\n\n7. For the car, the initial velocity is 30 m/s, the final velocity is 0 m/s, the acceleration is 11.93 m/s^2, and the time is 1.33 seconds.

The problem states that a blind taste test will be conducted with 9 volunteers to determine whether people can taste a difference between bottled water and tap water. Each participant will taste the water from two different glasses and then identify which glass he or she thinks contains the tap water. We need to find the probability that at least 8 of the 9 participants will correctly identify the tap water.\n\n2. Assuming that people cannot taste a difference between bottled water and tap water, the probability of a participant correctly identifying the tap water is 1/2, since there are two glasses and one of them must contain the tap water.\n\n3. To find the probability that at least 8 participants will correctly identify the tap water, we can use the concept of complementary probability. The complementary probability is the probability that 7 or fewer participants will correctly identify the tap water.\n\n4. We can calculate the probability of 7 or fewer participants correctly identifying the tap water by summing the probabilities of each case. There are 9 participants, so there are 9 different cases to consider: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 participants correctly identifying the tap water.\n\n5. The probability of each case can be calculated using the binomial coefficient and the probability of a participant correctly identifying the tap water, which is 1/2.

For example, the probability of 0 participants correctly identifying the tap water is: \n   Probability = 0 choose 9 * (1/2)^9 * (1/2)^0 = 1/512\n\n7. We can calculate the probabilities for each case and sum them up to get the probability of 7 or fewer participants correctly identifying the tap water.\n\n8. The probability of at least 8 participants correctly identifying the tap water is equal to 1 minus the probability of 7 or fewer participants correctly identifying the tap water.\n\n9. Therefore, the final result is 1 - (1/512) = 0.9980.\n\n10.

The problem states that we have a graph showing the position x as a function of time for the center of mass of a system of particles with a total mass of 6.0 kg. We need to find the resulting change in momentum of the system when an external force is exerted on an object in the system for a very short time interval around 2.0 s.\n\n2. The change in momentum of a system is given by the impulse, which is the integral of the force over time. In this case, we can see that the force is constant over the time interval, so the impulse is simply the force times the time interval.\n\n3. Looking at the graph, we can see that the position of the center of mass changes by 2 units in the positive x-direction over the time interval from 2.0 s to 3.0 s. Since the total mass of the system is 6.0 kg, the change in momentum is 2 units in the positive x-direction times the total mass of 6.0 kg, which gives us 2 * 6 = 12 kg\u00b7m/s.\n\n4. However, the problem asks for the resulting change in momentum, which takes into account the initial momentum of the system. From the graph, we can see that the initial momentum is 3 units in the negative x-direction.\n\n5. Therefore, the resulting change in momentum is the change in momentum minus the initial momentum, which gives us 12 kg\u00b7m/s - 3 kg\u00b7m/s = 9 kg\u00b7m/s.\n\n6. [Final solution] Thus, the resulting change in momentum of the system is 9 kg\u00b7m/s.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 9 kg\u00b7m/s.\nBy problem, the option corresponding to 9 kg\u00b7m/s is B.\nSo our selection is option B. #### B ", "pred": "B", "gold": "D", "result": false}

The problem states that Peter bought 2 watermelons, a banana, and an apple, which cost a total of $20. Joey bought a banana and 2 apples, which cost $7 less than Peter. We need to find out how much an apple costs.\n2. By problem, Joey bought a banana and 2 apples for $20 - $7 = $13.\n3. By problem, the unit price of watermelon is $3 higher than that of banana. Let's assume the price of banana is x dollars. Then the price of watermelon is x + $3 dollars.\n4. By problem, Peter bought 2 watermelons and 1 banana for $20. So the total cost of the watermelons and banana is 2(x + $3) + x = 3x + $6.\n5. By step 4, we know that the total cost of the watermelons and banana is $20. So we have the equation 3x + $6 = $20.\n6. To solve the equation, we subtract $6 from both sides: 3x + $6 - $6 = $20 - $6. Simplifying, we get 3x = $14.\n7. To isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: 3x/3 = $14/3.

The problem states that a commercial for a breakfast cereal is shown during a certain television program. The manufacturer of the cereal wants to estimate the percent of television viewers who watch the program. The manufacturer wants the estimate to have a margin of error of at most 0.02 at a level of 95 percent confidence. We need to find the smallest sample size that will satisfy the manufacturer's requirements.\n\n2. The formula for calculating the minimum required sample size for a given margin of error and confidence level is: \n   $$n \\geq \\left(\\frac{Z_{\\alpha/2}}{ME}\\right)^2 \\cdot p(1-p)$$\n   where:\n   - $$n$$ is the sample size\n   - $$Z_{\\alpha/2}$$ is the value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level\n   - $$ME$$ is the margin of error\n   - $$p$$ is the estimated proportion of the population that has the characteristic of interest (in this case, the proportion of television viewers who watch the program)\n\n3. By problem, the margin of error is 0.02 and the confidence level is 95%. Therefore, we have:\n   $$n \\geq \\left(\\frac{Z_{0.025}}{0.02}\\right)^2 \\cdot p(1-p)$$\n\n4. The value of $$Z_{0.025}$$ is approximately 1.96. Therefore, we have:\n   $$n \\geq \\left(\\frac{1.96}{0.02}\\right)^2 \\cdot p(1-p)$$\n\n5. Simplifying the expression, we have:\n   $$n \\geq 40p(1-p)$$\n\n6. Since we don't know the value of $$p$$, we need to assume a value for it. Let's assume $$p=0.5$$ (which is a conservative assumption, meaning it will give us a larger sample size). Therefore, we have:\n   $$n \\geq 40(0.5)(1-0.5)$$\n   $$n \\geq 40(0.5)(0.5)$$\n   $$n \\geq 10$$\n\n7. However, since we are looking for the smallest sample size, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the smallest sample size that will satisfy the manufacturer's requirements is 11.\n\n8. [Final solution] Thus, the smallest sample size that will satisfy the manufacturer's requirements is 11.\n   Therefore, the final result is 11.\n\n9.

We are given the following options: A. 0 m/s, B. 10 m/s, C. 20 m/s, D. 30 m/s.\n2. By problem, we are assuming no air resistance. In the absence of air resistance, the object will continue to accelerate until it hits the ground.\n3. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. This means that for each second the object falls, its velocity increases by 9.8 m/s.\n4. To find the time it takes for the object to fall, we divide the height (50 meters) by the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2): 50 meters / 9.8 m/s^2 = 50 / 9.8 = 5.1 seconds (rounded to the nearest tenth of a second).\n5. By step 3, we know that the object's velocity increases by 9.8 m/s for each second it falls. Therefore, after 5.1 seconds, the object's velocity will be 5.1 seconds * 9.8 m/s = 50 m/s.\n6. However, we need to find the velocity just before the object hits the ground, which is at the end of the 5.1 seconds. Therefore, we need to subtract the velocity at the end of the 5.1 seconds from the initial velocity of 0 m/s: 50 m/s - 0 m/s = 50 m/s.\n7.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary probability. The probability that the officer does not find any motorist driving more than 5 miles per hour over the speed limit is equal to the product of the probabilities for each motorist. Since the officer estimates that 40 percent of motorists will be driving more than 5 miles per hour over the speed limit, the probability for each motorist is 0.6 (1 - 0.4).\n\n3.

The problem states that Tony has 44 shoes and he has 11 more sneakers than boots. We need to find the equation that represents this situation.\n2. Let's assume the number of boots as a.\n3. By problem, Tony has 11 more sneakers than boots. Therefore, the number of sneakers is a + 11.\n4. The total number of shoes is the sum of the number of boots and the number of sneakers. Therefore, we have a + (a + 11) = 44.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 2a + 11 = 44.\n6. To isolate a, we subtract 11 from both sides of the equation: 2a = 44 - 11 = 33.\n7.

By observing the chart, we can see that as the time spent increases, the test score also increases. This indicates a positive relationship between the two variables.\n3. To determine the strength of the relationship, we need to calculate the correlational coefficient. The formula for the correlational coefficient is: $$r = \\frac{{(\\text{{sum of products}}) - (\\text{{sum of x's}})(\\text{{sum of y's}})}}{{\\sqrt{(\\text{{sum of squares of x's}})(\\text{{sum of squares of y's}})}}}$$\n4.

By problem, the lizard can walk 1.5 times its own length every second. Since the lizard is 20 cm in length, it can walk 1.5 * 20 cm = 30 cm every second.\n3. To convert cm to m, we know that 1 m = 100 cm. Therefore, 30 cm is equal to 30 cm / 100 cm/m = 0.3 m.\n4. By step 3, we know that the lizard can walk 0.3 m every second.\n5. To find out how long it would take for the lizard to walk 36 m, we divide the total distance by the distance the lizard can walk in one second: 36 m / 0.3 m/second = 120 seconds.\n6. By step 5, we know that it would take the lizard 120 seconds to walk 36 m.\n7. To convert seconds to minutes, we divide the number of seconds by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.\n8.

The problem states that a large-sample 98 percent confidence interval for the proportion of hotel reservations that are canceled on the intended arrival day is (0.048, 0.112). We need to find the point estimate for the proportion of hotel reservations that are canceled on the intended arrival day from which this interval was constructed.\n\n2. The point estimate for a proportion is the proportion itself. Therefore, we need to find the proportion of hotel reservations that are canceled on the intended arrival day.\n\n3. By problem, the confidence interval is (0.048, 0.112). The point estimate is the average of the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

The problem states that a hypothesis test is set up with n = 250 such that P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05. We need to determine which statement is true about the power of the test.\n2. The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, we want to find ways to increase the power of the test.\n3. By problem, we are given that P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05. This means that the alpha level, which represents the probability of a type I error, is 0.05.\n4. To increase the power of the test, we need to decrease the alpha level. This is because a lower alpha level corresponds to a higher probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n5. Therefore, the statement \"We can increase the power if we let alpha = 0.01\" is true. By setting alpha = 0.01, we decrease the probability of a type I error and increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.\n6. [Final solution] Thus, we can increase the power of the test by letting alpha = 0.01.\nTherefore, the final result is \"We can increase the power if we let alpha = 0.01\".\nBy problem, the option corresponding to \"We can increase the power if we let alpha = 0.01\" is B.\nSo our selection is option B. #### B ", "pred": "B", "gold": "D", "result": false}

The average number of hours worked per week at the part-time job for the teachers in the sample was 12.5 with standard deviation 6.5 hours. We need to determine if there is convincing statistical evidence, at the level of a = 0.05, that the average number of hours worked per week at part-time jobs decreased after the salary increase.\n\n2. To determine if there is convincing statistical evidence, we need to compare the average number of hours worked per week before and after the salary increase. The initial average is 13 hours, and the average after the salary increase is 12.5 hours.\n\n3. The standard deviation of the sample is 6.5 hours. We can use this information to calculate the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In this case, the standard error of the mean is 6.5 / sqrt(400) = 1.3 hours.\n\n4. To determine if the difference between the initial average and the average after the salary increase is statistically significant, we can calculate the z-score. The z-score is the difference between the two averages divided by the standard error of the mean. In this case, the z-score is (13 - 12.5) / 1.3 = 0.77.\n\n5. The p-value is the probability that the z-score is greater than or equal to the observed z-score. We can use a standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the p-value. In this case, the p-value is greater than 0.05.\n\n6. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, there is not convincing statistical evidence that the average number of hours worked per week at part-time jobs decreased after the salary increase.\n\n7.

The problem states that the sum of 7 numbers in an arithmetic sequence is 448. We need to find the smallest possible value of the smallest number in this sequence.\n2. To find the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula: sum = n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.\n3. By problem, the sum is 448 and the number of terms is 7. We can set up the equation: 448 = 7/2 * (first term + last term).\n4. Simplifying the equation, we get: 448 = 7/2 * (2 * first term).\n5. Dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we get: 448/7 = first term.\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 64 = first term.\n7. Therefore, the first term of the sequence is 64.\n8. To find the smallest number in the sequence, we can subtract 6 times the common difference from the first term. Since the common difference is not given, we need to find it.\n9. By problem, the sum of the sequence is 448 and the first term is 64. We can set up the equation: 448 = 7/2 * (64 + last term).\n10.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 448 * (2/7) = 64 + last term.\n13. Simplifying the equation, we get: 312 = 64 + last term.\n14. Subtracting 64 from both sides of the equation, we get: 248 = last term.\n15. Therefore, the last term of the sequence is 248.\n16. To find the smallest number in the sequence, we can subtract 6 times the common difference from the first term. By steps 7 and 15, the first term is 64 and the last term is 248. We can set up the equation: smallest number = 64 - 6 * (248 - 64).\n17. Simplifying the equation, we get: smallest number = 64 - 6 * (184).\n18. Simplifying the equation, we get: smallest number = 64 - 1104.\n19. Simplifying the equation, we get: smallest number = -1040.\n20. Therefore, the smallest possible value of the smallest number in this sequence is -1040.\n21.

Since each parent is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance that they will pass on the dominant allele and a 50% chance that they will pass on the recessive allele.\n4. If both parents pass on the dominant allele, the offspring will have a rough coat. If both parents pass on the recessive allele, the offspring will have a smooth coat.\n5.

The problem states that in a large set of data that are approximately normally distributed, we have three values: r, s, and t. We need to determine the correct order from least to greatest for these values.\n2. By definition, the z-score of a value in a data set represents how many standard deviations that value is from the mean. A z-score of -1.00 indicates that the value is 1 standard deviation below the mean.\n3. The first quartile, denoted as s, is the value that is greater than 25% of the data set.\n4. The 20th percentile, denoted as t, is the value that is greater than 20% of the data set.\n5. Since r has a z-score of -1.00, it is 1 standard deviation below the mean. This means that r is less than both s and t.\n6. The 20th percentile (t) is less than the first quartile (s) because 20% is less than 25%.\n7.

The problem states that an airplane lands on a runway with a velocity of 150 m/s and its rate of deceleration is constant at -3 m/s^2. We need to find out how far the airplane will travel until it stops.\n2. To find the distance the airplane will travel, we can use the formula: distance = initial velocity * time + (1/2) * acceleration * time^2.\n3. By problem, the initial velocity of the airplane is 150 m/s and the acceleration is -3 m/s^2.\n4. Let's assume the time it takes for the airplane to stop is \"t\" seconds.\n5. Using the formula from step 2, we can write the equation: distance = 150t + (1/2) * (-3) * t^2.\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get: distance = 150t - 3t^2.\n7. We can further simplify the equation by factoring out \"t\" from the terms with \"t\": distance = t(150 - 3t).\n8. To find the value of \"t\", we can set the equation equal to zero and solve for \"t\": 150 - 3t = 0.\n9. Solving for \"t\", we get: t = 150/3 = 50 seconds.\n10. Now that we know the time it takes for the airplane to stop, we can substitute the value of \"t\" back into the equation from step 7 to find the distance: distance = 50(150 - 3(50)).\n11. Simplifying the equation, we get: distance = 50(150 - 150) = 50(0) = 0 m.\n12. However, we need to find the total distance the airplane will travel, not just the distance it travels after it stops. Since the airplane starts with a velocity of 150 m/s, it will travel 150 meters in the first second.\n13. Adding the distance it travels after it stops (0 m) to the initial distance it travels (150 m), we get: total distance = 150 m + 0 m = 150 m.\n14.

The problem states that the distribution of weights of shipped boxes is approximately normal with a mean of 36 pounds and a standard deviation of 4 pounds. We need to find the weight, in pounds, at the 75th percentile of the distribution.\n2. To find the 75th percentile, we need to find the value of x such that P(X > x) = 0.75, where X is the random variable representing the weight of the boxes.\n3. The standard normal distribution has a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of P(X < x) = 0.5 + 0.5*erf(x/sqrt(2)), where erf is the error function.\n4. We can convert the problem to a standard normal distribution problem by using the formula Z = (X - mu) / sigma, where Z is the standard score, X is the value we want to convert, mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.\n5. Plugging in the values, we have P(36 + 4*Z > 36) = 0.75.\n6. Simplifying the inequality, we have 4*Z > 0, or Z > 0/4.\n7. Converting back to the standard normal distribution, we have P(Z > 0.25) = 0.75.\n8. Using the standard normal distribution CDF, we have P(Z > 0.25) = 0.5 + 0.5*erf(0.25/sqrt(2)) = 0.75.\n9.

The problem states that three football teams participate in a sport tournament. Each team plays the other two teams exactly once. In each game, the winner gets three points and the loser doesn't get any points. If the game ends in a tie, each team gets 1 point. We need to find out which number of points is impossible for any team to have at the end of the tournament.\n\n2. Each team plays 2 games. There are three possible outcomes for each game: a win, a loss, or a tie. Let's analyze the possible point totals for each team:\n\n   - 1 point: This can be achieved by losing one game and tying the other game.\n   - 2 points: This can be achieved by tying both games.\n   - 3 points: This can be achieved by losing one game and winning the other game.\n   - 4 points: This can be achieved by winning one game and tying the other game.\n   - 6 points: This can be achieved by winning both games.\n\n3. From the analysis in step 2, we can see that the possible point totals for each team are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\n4. However, the problem asks for the number of points that is impossible for any team to have. Since 5 points is not one of the possible point totals, it is impossible for any team to have 5 points.\n\n5.

The problem states that cart A moves horizontally on a frictionless track and collides with identical cart B, which is at rest. We need to predict the speed of the carts after the collision.\n2. By problem, the speed of cart A before the collision is measured to be 3.0 m/s, with an uncertainty of +0.2 m/s.\n3. Since the collision is elastic, the total kinetic energy of the two carts after the collision is equal to the kinetic energy of cart A before the collision.\n4. Let's denote the speed of cart A after the collision as v1 and the speed of cart B after the collision as v2. We can set up the equation: 1/2 * m * (v1^2 + v2^2) = 1/2 * m * (3.0 +/- 0.2)^2, where m is the mass of each cart.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: v1^2 + v2^2 = (3.0 +/- 0.2)^2.\n6. Taking the square root of both sides, we get: v1 = v2 = sqrt((3.0 +/- 0.2)^2) = 3.0 +/- 0.2.\n7. Since the carts are identical, we can conclude that v1 = v2 = 3.0 +/- 0.2.\n8.

By observation, we can see that if we choose the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 17, 18, we can guarantee that no two chosen numbers will sum to 35. This is because the sum of any two numbers from this sequence will be less than 35.\n3. However, if we choose the number 19, we need to exclude the number 16 to ensure that no two chosen numbers sum to 35. This is because 19 + 16 = 35.\n4. Similarly, if we choose the number 20, we need to exclude the number 15. If we choose the number 21, we need to exclude the number 14. And so on.\n5.

The problem states that there are five different awards to be given to three students. Each student will receive at least one award. We need to find out how many different ways the awards can be distributed.\n2. Since each student will receive at least one award, we can start by giving each student one award. This leaves us with two awards remaining.\n3. We need to find the number of ways to distribute the remaining two awards to the three students. We can think of this as choosing two students out of the three to receive the remaining awards. This can be represented by the combination formula: $\\binom{3}{2}$.\n4. By the combination formula, $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = 3$.\n5. However, we need to consider that the awards can be distributed in three different ways: one student gets two awards, and the other two students get one award each; two students get two awards each, and one student gets no awards; or two students get one award each, and one student gets no awards.\n6. To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of ways to choose two students (from step 4) by the number of ways to distribute the remaining two awards (from step 5): $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n7. However, we need to consider that there are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose the two students who will receive the first awards.\n8.

To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of ways to choose two students (from step 9) by the number of ways to distribute the remaining two awards (from step 8): $3 \\times 90 = 270$.\n11. However, we need to consider that there are $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose the three students who will receive the awards.\n12. To find the total number of ways, we multiply the number of ways to choose three students (from step 11) by the number of ways to distribute the remaining two awards (from step 10): $10 \\times 270 = 2700$.\n13.
